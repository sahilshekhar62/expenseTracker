ExpenseTracker Project - Setup Instructions

This guide explains how to set up and run the ExpenseTracker application, which includes both backend (Express.js) and frontend (React) components.

1. Backend Setup (Express.js)

1.1 Install Dependencies

1. Open your terminal and go to the backend directory:
   cd backend
2. Install all required packages:
   npm install

1.2 MongoDB Configuration

3. Go to the MongoDB Atlas website and sign in or create a new account.
4. Create a new project and proceed through the prompts.
5. In the navigation menu, click on Clusters and then Build a Cluster.
6. Choose the Free Tier, select a provider and region, and create your cluster.
7. Once your cluster is ready, add your current IP address for database access or allow access from anywhere.
8. Create a database user with a username and password.

1.3 Connect Your Application

9. In the cluster view, click Connect, choose Drivers, and select Node.js.
10. Copy the connection string provided.
11. In your backend folder, create a .env file if it doesnâ€™t exist, and add the following:
    MONGODB_URI=your_connection_string
    Replace <password> with your database user password.
12. Generate a JWT secret by running:
    node -e "console.log(require('crypto').randomBytes(64).toString('hex'))"
13. Add this value to your .env file:
    JWT_SECRET=your_generated_secret

1.4 Run the Backend Server
